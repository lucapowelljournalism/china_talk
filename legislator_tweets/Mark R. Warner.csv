"I just sent a letter with @TimKaine urging @VP, @GovernorVA, and state and federal health agencies to waive costs that may prevent Coronavirus patients from seeking diagnosis and treatment.

"If the President is talking about the #RestoreOurParks Act that I’ve been working on for years with @SenRobPortman, @SenAlexander, and @SenAngusKing, then let’s do it. Proud to have bipartisan support for rebuilding America’s national parks. https://t.co/vuwiZCnovY",2020-03-04 01:04:29

"The last time this nomination was unsuccessfully put forward, serious bipartisan questions were raised about Rep. Ratcliffe’s background and qualifications. 

It’s hard for me to see how anything new has happened to change that. https://t.co/c576JHXcR8",2020-02-28 23:26:34

Looking forward to seeing friends from Virginia and around the country next week at the @AIPAC Policy Conference.,2020-02-27 23:09:00
"For the first time in our history, Congress passed legislation to make lynching a federal hate crime. I applaud my colleagues @SenKamalaHarris, @SenatorTimScott &amp; @CoryBooker for seeing this bill through the Senate last year, and I look forward to seeing it get signed into law. https://t.co/4A6408pJfo",2020-02-27 22:28:23
"When it comes to the #Coronavirus, my priority is making sure that officials in Virginia have the resources they need to adequately respond to any potential cases in the Commonwealth. In the meantime, I encourage every Virginian to heed @CDCgov warnings and advisories. https://t.co/j44GRiZNWn",2020-02-27 21:17:09
"The truth is – an overwhelming majority of Americans support background checks for gun sales. And one full year after House passage of #HR8, it’s long past time to bring this commonsense bill up for a Senate vote. #BackgroundChecksSaveLives",2020-02-27 19:12:00
