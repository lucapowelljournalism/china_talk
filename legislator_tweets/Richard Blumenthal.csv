Republican roadblocks to relief payments—affecting millions—must be removed. No one should be denied vital help. Corrections must be made in the next emergency package. https://t.co/TZchVamPCv,2020-04-15 13:52:15
"Unacceptable. During a pandemic the last thing we should do is underfund &amp; undermine the WHO. They warned about an imminent, insidious threat, which Trump &amp; his Admin chose to ignore.

"Having failed to provide critical medical equipment, the least the Trump Admin can do is cover states’ cost share. If not, Congress must act to waive states’ 25% funding share in the next relief package. Red state or blue it’s real money.",2020-04-13 14:16:23

.@CTFoodBank is doing vital work to feed our communities during this crisis. Speaking w/organizers of the mobile pantry made it crystal clear the demand is huge &amp; resources are limited.
