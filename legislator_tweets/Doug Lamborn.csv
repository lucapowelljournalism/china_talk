Welcome to Colorado Springs @VP. https://t.co/lEm8smyIDy,2020-02-20 22:18:30
.@realDonaldTrump's blue-collar boom is the largest economic expansion in history. @POTUS &amp; @VP have created thousands of jobs in our district alone. Their pro-growth and pro-jobs agenda has led to record low unemployment throughout Colorado and the USA. https://t.co/ddWh4RJmDj,2020-02-20 20:07:58

"When I requested a vote on the #BornAlive Abortion Survivors Protection Act on the House Floor, Democrats silenced my microphone. I am thrilled to hear that @senatemajldr will be bringing it up for a vote. I call on Pelosi to bring this bill for a vote in the House.",2020-02-15 00:24:40

Glad to lead an amicus brief with @SenMikeLee &amp; @RepDougCollins supporting schools protected by the 1st Amendment's ministerial exception &amp; battling for religious liberty. America was founded on the right to practice religion freely. The Supreme Court should uphold this standard. https://t.co/KBBF1m2yMu,2020-02-14 19:51:45
"And in the meantime @realDonaldTrump:
1) Signed USMCA &amp;  China trade deal
2) Introduced a Middle East Peace Plan
3) Eliminated national security threats
4) Delivered consistently low unemployment 
5) Created the greatest economy of our lifetime

The contrast really is shocking. https://t.co/LPCJxqgh5s",2020-02-13 22:09:37

"The comparison between House Dems and @HouseGOP is stunning. Dems can't be bothered to propose a budget, because all they care about is removing @realDonaldTrump from office.
