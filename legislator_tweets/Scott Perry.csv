Adam Schiff and House Democrats failed to make a case for impeachment; it’s not the Senate’s job now.  Having the Senate call additional witnesses is like asking the judge and jury in a murder trial to go and collect evidence on the accused.,2020-01-28 22:26:38
"Mocking Americans is a new low for CNN. In 2014, when Russian tanks were invading Ukraine, Democrats didn’t care to look at Ukraine on a map or read the news to understand the true threat the Ukrainian people faced. Where was CNN’s outcry then?  https://t.co/siMnBGmHUK",2020-01-28 21:27:42

Hey all - here’s the DC recap for last week. Have a great week - stay warm! https://t.co/bkslrn2blW,2019-12-17 16:12:11
The Democrats on the Judiciary Committee just said that foreign-policy must be left to the “professionals.” Heaven forbid the President thinks he can be involved in foreign-policy! Do you think the “professionals” will be accountable in any election?,2019-12-12 21:13:57
Democrats apparently don’t understand and refuse to accept the legitimate separation of powers. They weren’t willing to go to court but they are sure willing to abuse their own power and take the law into their own hands.,2019-12-12 20:53:55
Democrats on the Judiciary Committee are acting as though oversight means the executive branch must bow to the legislative branch. They didn’t feel that way when a President said he would use his pen and a phone.,2019-12-12 20:53:30
"Democrats on the Judiciary Committee are telling you that if a President doesn’t help them railroad him, then he must be guilty of anything for which he’s accused. Aren’t you happy the judicial system doesn’t treat you that way?",2019-12-12 20:52:25
"Democrats on the Judiciary Committee just admitted they can determine what evidence they choose to use to impeach the President. Agreed. Republicans just think impeachment ought to be based on High Crimes and Misdemeanors, not because Dems don’t like the President.",2019-12-12 20:51:38

"Before his testimony today, Jonathan Turley - Democrat - noted that Schiff’s public hearings failed to provide a complete picture and “conflicted on critical points.” Do you wonder why Democrats didn’t call HIM as their own witness?",2019-12-04 16:13:26

"Mr. Feldman who just testified in favor of impeachment, called for impeachment of the President less than two months after he was elected. What was the impeachable offense, a tweet? Do you think Feldman is impartial?",2019-12-04 15:56:08

Dr. Hill testified that she often tried to verify Ambassador Sondland’s claims of meeting with POTUS and often found that the alleged meeting had not taken place.,2019-11-21 19:06:00
