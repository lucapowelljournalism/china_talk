Below's an example of how bringing more lenders into SBA's #PPP &amp; #EIDL programs means neglected businesses can get help. It's why I'm fighting to improve the programs and helped Inclusiv members (@CDCU_Federation) become @SBAGov lenders. Now they're aiding Puerto Rico businesses https://t.co/eo7CroxQDA,2020-04-18 14:30:00
"So, @realDonaldTrump, when you said yesterday that Governors were going to decide how to reopen and you'd be there to ""help,"" you really meant you'd let them make tough choices that save lives, while you play infantile political games? https://t.co/V4LmSWx900",2020-04-17 20:12:45

"Sen. @marcorubio recently said the PPP program is not a Wall Street package. I agree.

"We need transparency and safeguards to be certain that funds from #PaycheckProtectionProgram reach true small businesses. Big companies shouldn't use up resources intended for struggling neighborhood small businesses, which are suffering so severely.

The stakes are too high to shortchange small businesses during this crisis. @senatemajldr’s #SmallBizRelief bill is inadequate and will leave the most vulnerable small businesses out to dry. @housedemocrats are fighting for a comprehensive solution. https://t.co/6XYQ6MhFSo,2020-04-15 15:05:00
