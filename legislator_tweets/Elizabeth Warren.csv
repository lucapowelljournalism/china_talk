The compressor station being built in Weymouth is already a health &amp; safety nightmare. Now ongoing construction during this health crisis puts workers &amp; the community at risk again. @Enbridge must explain what it's doing to prevent the spread of COVID-19. https://t.co/PHFpPGxZJY,2020-04-21 01:26:52
I'm very glad that Massachusetts has passed into law a moratorium on evictions &amp; foreclosures during this pandemic. Now Congress should follow the Commonwealth's lead and enact a universal national moratorium. https://t.co/SJMO0b7cgt,2020-04-21 01:05:18

"MA has the third most COVID-19 cases in the country. Our cities &amp; counties need help.

It’s 200 days until Election Day &amp; Congress hasn’t addressed the health &amp; safety of America’s voters during this pandemic. There's no time for partisanship.

Providing $5M in aid to Palestinians is not enough.
