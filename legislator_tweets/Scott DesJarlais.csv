From historic lows to historic highs.  It cannot be argued that the #UnemploymentRate is sustainable and that it must continue unabated for the foreseeable future.  America must reopen - however it needs to happen.,2020-05-08 15:53:38
"A shame that a group of people at the top level of the FBI brought shame and destroyed reputations in an agency with an overwhelming number of good people trying to serve the community.  Those engaged in this fiasco must be held accountable.

"I'd hate to recommend TN Volunteers not go to NY in the future, but are you kidding me?  You're not subsidizing anything Gov. Cuomo.  You can simply elect to not take money from people who came to your state to help when you asked.

"Happy Easter. It’s the first time in 18 years I haven’t been able to celebrate at our little church in Sherwood, TN. For my wife, it was the first time ever. We attended a virtual service. Next year, I know things will be different. Let’s enjoy this hopeful season. https://t.co/VDuiWLFZ5q",2020-04-12 17:40:56

"When Donald Trump warned the country of coronavirus from China and declared the U.S. would work to defeat it — Nancy Pelosi tore up his speech. She was too busy with impeachment to help Donald Trump protect the country, which he has worked hard to do despite these childish antics https://t.co/IBFAB8Nxdq",2020-04-01 18:56:32
"I’m so pleased to see manufacturers small and large contributing to our nationwide effort to defeat coronavirus.

"Antibody tests like this will help us  to better understand the scale of coronavirus and determine who has immunity, so more can rejoin the workforce to earn a living again, and to care for patients. Innovation to combat this virus is accelerating and impressive. https://t.co/a7SGwLvYgA",2020-04-01 13:11:54
"While Donald Trump was responding to coronavirus, Nancy Pelosi was handing out commemorative impeachment pens. Very early, he formed the Coronavirus Task Force, restricted travel from danger zones, and declared a public health emergency. https://t.co/A8m0QVoPYM",2020-03-31 23:32:31
"When Donald Trump was dealing with coronavirus, Nancy Pelosi was stuck on impeachment. Even just a few weeks ago, the Speaker had scheduled more open-borders legislation for a vote but withdrew it as top scientists lauded travel restrictions President implemented very early https://t.co/pZDnGPTtKV",2020-03-31 14:57:59
"The President has already shown remarkable foresight and energy in implementing an America First agenda that reduces our country’s dependence on unreliable China, where the Communist Party created the conditions for coronavirus and concealed the extent. https://t.co/U8OdpJIoY7",2020-03-30 19:32:58
"The basic idea is for Tennesseans to continue “social distancing” to keep one another, especially our most vulnerable citizens, safe. Reducing groups will help to slow coronavirus and allow health care facilities to respond effectively. This will be temporary. https://t.co/pCHZm3Gbvn",2020-03-30 19:28:02
We’re fixing outdated regulations that hampered widespread testing  and replenishing stockpiles. New testing methods and treatments are emerging almost daily. Private industry and government are working hand in hand. Americans are helping one another to defeat coronavirus! https://t.co/40OPW0NwWo,2020-03-30 13:19:13
The Liberal Media media is determined to prevent you from watching the President of the United States deliver updates about coronarvirus. Would anybody trust these reporters to report his daily briefings accurately? The briefings are a great source of information!,2020-03-29 23:03:13
"Here’s what’s really going on with the Resistance, which hasn’t changed even when the rest of the country is pulling together. Impeaching the President when he’s dealing with coronavirus. Obstructing solutions in Congress. Attack ads on TV. Just give us a hand please. https://t.co/FY5VASP1LD",2020-03-29 17:13:04
"You’re better off watching the daily Coronavirus Task Force briefing than most mainstream media, doing its best to inflame the public with faulty analysis. Despite the current challenge, there is encouraging data indicating the limits of coronavirus. We have great capability. https://t.co/MA6rqGJbJ4",2020-03-27 15:13:35
"The federal government had a unproductive stranglehold on testing. But once President Trump lifted restrictions, opening testing to private labs and states, testing accelerated rapidly. https://t.co/pNPICpuDOD",2020-03-27 15:04:17
"All too common attitude on the Left and in liberal media — praising communist regime that spread coronavirus around the globe, while attacking the President who warned of China, impeaching him during initial response, and spending big on negative TV ads rather than assisting.",2020-03-25 19:02:35
"At a time when we’re trying to get businesses and employees back up and running, Nancy Pelosi thought now would be a great time to saddle them with MORE COSTS as part of the Green New Deal, which the Resistance is trying to shove into emergency coronavirus relief. Unbelievable.",2020-03-24 14:27:30

"White House Office of Science and Tech is organizing coronavirus “consortium” of public and private computing resources. Researchers will have immense power to analyze spread of coronavirus, methods to prevent it, and new cures! Another example of the many tools at our disposal. https://t.co/f8aZmAxw54",2020-03-23 17:09:37
"Encouraging calm, projecting confidence and giving hope to Americans is exactly what the President should be doing, hardly evidence of mismanagement or downplaying coronavirus. We can and should be optimistic as the country continues to respond to with all our might.",2020-03-22 15:31:21
"This is pretty low. After pursuing another failed impeachment — as the President was leading our national response to coronavirus — Democrats immediately began pouring money into negative attack ads. All politics, all the time.  Resistance. Obstruction. We will succeed anyway! https://t.co/fFYf5ZP92I",2020-03-22 14:24:31
Testing problems were the result of federal regulations — some with good reason — preventing private-sector and state involvement. The President acted quickly to solve problems with the process. Testing and evaluations are speeding up. The best minds are working on treatments. https://t.co/x1EdQqIVy9,2020-03-21 19:13:14
Donald Trump must be one of the most media-accessible presidents ever. He takes questions all the time. But the WH press room briefings have become opportunities for reporters to yell and scream. Many are still stuck in unhelpful Resistance mode. https://t.co/gh8UscbeQ4,2020-03-21 18:55:03
"You can’t “telecommute” if you tend a herd, drive a truck, stock shelves, ring a register, provide security, or any number of jobs that require a little elbow grease. How about a hand for all the great people who make America work and don’t usually get the accolades 👏👏👏👏👏👏",2020-03-20 21:01:18
"In the best of times, it’s hard for a small business to pay its bills. Margins are thin. When this is all over, and it will be, we should remember that federal taxes and regulations eat up weeks and months of revenue for owners trying to stay afloat. We’re currently waiving many.",2020-03-20 19:57:39
"It’s not just that CCP (Chinese Communist Party) hid coronavirus from world and did little to stop spread. Primary problem is CCP’s flouting of environmental and health standards, in order to undercut competing economies, that create conditions for succession of outbreaks.",2020-03-19 11:49:53
"CCP hid virus from world, allowed it to get out of hand, and at the same time, threatens to withhold medication to treat coronavirus. Ultimate result of this situation will be to move drug manufacturing out of China, as we are doing with other industries, for our own protection. https://t.co/q0eZ0MzKIG",2020-03-19 11:45:43
"This is some of the best evidence the Chinese government (CCP) lied about the extent of the coronavirus disease and delayed an effective response — and why Donald Trump restricted travel from China so early. The regime, spewing blatantly false propaganda, is not to be trusted. https://t.co/Tn599W506d",2020-03-19 03:51:29

"Chances are you will not get coronavirus, but if you do, you’ll make a full recovery fairly quickly. That said, you don’t want it, and you don’t want to spread it. Be smart. Be calm also.

"The latest news from the Get Trump media is that he disbanded pandemic response unit at NSC — completely false. It’s stronger and more focused after a streamlining.

"President Trump stopped flights from China and Iran very early. Slowness of some countries to act forced us to stop flights from Europe as well.
