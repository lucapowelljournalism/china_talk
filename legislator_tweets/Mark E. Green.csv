Chinese officials waited SIX days after secretly determining they were facing a pandemic—letting Wuhan host a mass banquet for millions to celebrate the Lunar New Year—before warning the public. Unacceptable. https://t.co/tVNW3FEJ0y,2020-04-15 19:45:07

"Between December 31—when cases were first reported—and January 31—some 430,000 people were on direct flights from China to the U.S. If @POTUS hadn’t ignored the WHO, who knows how many more Americans would be infected by now?",2020-04-14 20:27:52
