Thanks to @orlandosentinel for its support of my legislation with @SenAmyKlobuchar. It's time to expand emergency #VoteByMail through November to protect Americans and our elections. This can't wait. https://t.co/ri04d1xbnH,2020-04-03 20:08:30
Millions of workers are filing for unemployment &amp; businesses around the country are struggling to stay afloat. This crisis isn't going away soon. The rise in jobless claims makes it clear Congress must continue working on the next relief bill to get Americans the help they need.,2020-04-03 17:07:51
Great conversation yesterday with @Lines_for_Life. Staying healthy is just as much about mental wellness as it is physical. While many are feeling isolated as we practice social distancing it’s critical to ensure every American has access to the mental health resources they need. https://t.co/TnTtxluODi,2020-04-02 21:13:26
The provision @SenGaryPeters and I fought to include in the CARES Act will supercharge unemployment benefits and provide a lifeline for workers who have been hit by this economic wrecking ball. https://t.co/nIYChkLMVv,2020-04-02 20:08:56
I’ve been pressing @USTreasury to cut the red tape so seniors are able to get the help they urgently need to weather this storm. I’m glad the Treasury Dept. has updated its guidance so seniors will automatically receive their checks and get immediate access to this lifeline. https://t.co/aWJWBQqDrH,2020-04-02 19:00:52

On day one of negotiations for the #COVID19 relief package I made it clear that my bottom line was helping workers replace lost wages. Modernizing our outdated unemployment system ensures that all workers — including self-employed and gig economy workers — get the help they need. https://t.co/3NwsspRCiu,2020-04-02 15:25:18

"These abuses only came to light when an outside investigator was able to examine the facts.

Workers who have lost their jobs can't afford to wait for help. @SenSanders @SenSchumer and I are asking the Labor Department to expedite distribution of supercharged unemployment we secured in the #COVID19 relief package to get Americans the help they urgently need. https://t.co/RxV4V8R6Ql,2020-04-01 18:49:36

.@SenSherrodBrown @SenSchumer and I are demanding Steve Mnuchin fulfill his commitment to independent oversight and ensure that #COVID19 emergency relief and loans go to workers and struggling businesses. Not a slush fund to benefit Donald Trump’s friends and donors. https://t.co/vxPTFa4rso,2020-04-01 16:14:58
