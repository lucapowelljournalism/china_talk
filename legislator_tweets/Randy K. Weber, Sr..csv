“Pelosi &amp; Company’s” days are numbered. Americans are seeing them for who they are. Our great President is persevering in spite of them! Look how far we’ve come under his leadership. How much further could we have come with just a little help from the D’s? Sad! @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/jokK3SmStN,2020-01-15 19:45:25
Artemis: shouldn’t the program be run out of Johnson Space Center? JSC has the best reputation for managing manned space flight! Why change something that’s been working? @HouseScience @HouseScienceGOP https://t.co/s7NSwhmxO4,2020-01-15 19:40:08

"Alec Baldwin lecturing on “12 cylinder economy” issues, &amp; morality?How “rich” is that? Not as rich as “out of touch actor” who lectures working Americans:beneficiaries of Trump’s great economy!

"Isn’t it odd Lopez can say something “crazy” &amp; some say stupid; (welcome to the Liberal Mindset - They would let the ship sink, just because they can’t be the Capt!)
