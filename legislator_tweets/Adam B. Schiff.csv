"The President's legal defense boils down to this:

Deprive Americans of a fair trial.

But Americans know what a fair trial looks like. They know it requires witnesses and documents.

If Trump's team succeeds in orchestrating a trial without them,

There will be no exoneration. https://t.co/WEJkFMZBbo",2020-01-26 17:41:41
"After listening to the President’s lawyers opening arguments, I have three observations:

They don’t contest the facts of Trump’s scheme.

They’re trying to deflect, distract from, and distort the truth.

And they are continuing to cover it up by blocking documents and witnesses.",2020-01-25 17:06:03
"All over the world, those living under oppressive regimes look to us. 

They look to us because we have a rule of law. Because in America, no one is above that law. 

To my Senate colleagues, I implore you:

Give America a fair trial.

She's worth it. https://t.co/FoPdno5Qy4",2020-01-25 02:14:18
"Let’s imagine it wasn’t Joe Biden.

Let’s imagine it was any one of us.

Let’s imagine the most powerful man in the world was asking a foreign nation to conduct a sham investigation of us.

What would we think about it then?

Because next time, it might be. https://t.co/WlnlPPGSCY",2020-01-24 20:53:20
"Donald Trump must be convicted and removed from office.

Because he will always choose his own personal interest over our national interest.
 
Because in America, right matters. Truth matters.
 
If not, no Constitution can protect us.

If not, we are lost. https://t.co/USfx6v9KsT",2020-01-24 04:10:06
"Americans know about Trump's Ukraine scheme because people with a sense of duty were willing to step forward and speak out.

People like Ambassadors Yovanovitch and Taylor, Lt. Col. Vindman, Dr. Hill.

They were willing to risk their careers. Can Members of Congress do the same? https://t.co/ac3WvdYULR",2020-01-23 03:38:27
"Time and time again, President Trump has shown he will continue to abuse his power, unless we hold him accountable.

The only appropriate remedy for a President of the United States so unwilling to be constrained by the rule of law?

Impeachment, and removal from office. https://t.co/JOlxRLllUB",2020-01-23 00:01:33
"Senators get 16 hours to ask questions. Wouldn't they like to ask about documents?

If McConnell gets his way, they won't see any documents before their questions.

Even if documents are allowed later, they can't ask a single question about them.

Americans deserve a fair trial. https://t.co/wF5SBs9xV8",2020-01-22 00:50:04
"Trump's lawyer claimed the House isn't ready to present our case.

We’re ready.

The House calls John Bolton to testify. The House calls Mick Mulvaney.

We’re ready to present our case, ready to call witnesses, ready to see the documents.

The question: Will the Senate let us? https://t.co/MD5d1bqsxU",2020-01-21 21:55:08
"Americans want a fair trial.

They want to believe their government is still capable of rising to the occasion.

They want to believe we can rise above party, to do what’s best for our country.

Sadly, a great many Americans doubt this is still possible.

Let's prove them wrong. https://t.co/VGor4FSQdS",2020-01-21 20:06:53
"President Trump has engaged in the trifecta of constitutional misconduct warranting removal.

He invited foreign interference, endangered our national security, and sought to cheat in the next election. 

He is the Framers’ worst nightmare.

Our response: https://t.co/h4rMqq5lTc",2020-01-20 18:12:23
"No, Mr. President, we did ask John Bolton to testify. You ordered him not to, and blocked others, like Mick Mulvaney.

All Americans know what a fair trial includes documents and witnesses. 

What are you hiding? https://t.co/XIMPtZa74O",2020-01-20 17:03:18
"As we remember and honor the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., we must also challenge ourselves to live up to Dr. King’s example and continue to fight for the principles he held dear – tolerance, justice, and truth.

Dr. King's work is not yet finished. It is up to all of us.",2020-01-20 16:10:17
"Americans are watching, and they overwhelmingly support a fair trial. One that is fair to the President but also fair to the American people.
 
If Senators do not provide a fair trial, with documents and witnesses, history — and their constituents — will judge them harshly. https://t.co/AUsBOXNbrT",2020-01-19 19:13:35
"Americans overwhelmingly want to see a fair trial.  That is the foundational issue on which everything else rests.

But will Senators allow witnesses and subpoena documents?
 
If Senators are true to the oath they have taken to impartially administer justice, they must do so. https://t.co/9cHAOODgow",2020-01-19 17:23:57
"The case against the President is simple, and the evidence overwhelming.
 
He abused his power by soliciting foreign interference in our election, withholding military aid from our ally, and 
 
Jeopardizing our national security, elections and democracy.

"If the Vice President believes all of the witnesses who testified before the House contradict Mr. Parnas, why won’t he let the public see the supplemental testimony of his own staffer, Jennifer Williams?

There is no reason it should be classified. Release it, Mr. Vice President. https://t.co/tfQ7uIHOdG",2020-01-16 21:02:31
"Mr. Parnas’ public interviews and documents shed light on the origins and key players in Trump's scheme.

His information, Bolton's offer to testify, and the GAO's finding of Trump's illegality all underscore the need for a fair trial.

The American people deserve all the facts.",2020-01-16 19:01:09
"The nonpartisan Government Accountability Office has found the Trump Administration broke the law by withholding military aid from Ukraine.

Trump’s willingness to break the law to coerce Ukraine to help him cheat in the next election shows the magnitude of his abuse of power. https://t.co/WgrJa3spcx",2020-01-16 16:13:14
"The task before us is a grave but necessary one.

Donald J. Trump tried to get a foreign nation to help him cheat in the next election.

For that reason, he was impeached.

And for that reason, the only remedy is conviction and removal from office. https://t.co/rjT673texi",2020-01-15 19:05:04
"I'm humbled by the solemn responsibility of serving as lead House Manager in the Senate impeachment trial.
 
Together, the Managers will work on behalf of the American people in defense of our Constitution.
 
The House upheld our Constitutional duty. The Senate must do the same.",2020-01-15 15:58:13
"Today, we take the next step to #DefendOurDemocracy, sending articles of impeachment to the Senate.
 
McConnell will have a choice: stand with the Constitution, or with Trump’s cover-up.
 
Uphold the rule of law, or help Trump undermine it.",2020-01-15 13:37:50
"McConnell says the Senate shouldn’t hear witnesses or see documents, as if it’s not a trial, only an appeal.

But the trial has yet to begin:

These new materials show exactly why we need a fair trial — with documents and witnesses.

Not a coverup by the President and his men. https://t.co/KFgHlDdocf",2020-01-15 02:38:31
"The overwhelming majority of the American people want to see a fair trial — fair to the president, and fair to the public.

But Mitch McConnell wants to block witnesses and documents, an unprecedented attempt to obscure the truth.

That's not a fair trial. It's a cover up. https://t.co/zy2LBHWKrM",2020-01-14 17:47:46
"The Russians appear to be at it again. According to a new report, they’re hacking information that could be a prelude to more election interference in 2020.

And again, it appears aimed to help Trump.

We must reject foreign meddling.

Americans should decide American elections. https://t.co/ipFsqq5yJz",2020-01-14 03:13:26
"Trump just tweeted:

“I stand stronger than anyone in protecting your Healthcare with Pre- Existing Conditions.”

How absurd.

His Administration is in court—right now—trying to repeal the entire ACA, including protections for pre-existing conditions.

No one is fooled.",2020-01-14 00:53:43
