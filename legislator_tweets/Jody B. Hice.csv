"Democrats &amp; Republicans must work together to stop the spread of #coronavirus - and prepare for the worst.

I'm working with @RepSchneider &amp; @RepSchakowsky to enact HR 6062, a bill to empower the @US_FDA to import medical devices (masks, respirators, etc) from overseas if needed. https://t.co/IK0SwKjdWy",2020-03-11 16:13:51
".@realDonaldTrump acted early to stop the spread of #coronavirus by declaring a public health emergency &amp; putting travel restrictions from China on Jan 31.

Then, Democrats and the media accused @POTUS of fear-mongering and xenophobia.

The President‚Äôs early actions saved lives! https://t.co/DGIC5u96Ut",2020-03-11 16:04:11
".@RepMaloney, today's #coronavirus hearing in @GOPoversight is not the time to be scoring cheap political points.

As Members of Congress, regardless of political party, we must work together to combat COVID-19.

Your partisan snipes against @realDonaldTrump are not constructive.",2020-03-11 15:42:02
"When the House considers reauthorizing FISA, remember:

‚û°Ô∏èDOJ IG found gross incompetence &amp; bias in the FBI's handling of FISA

‚û°Ô∏èFISA Court said they can no longer 100% trust FBI FISA applications

‚û°Ô∏èDemocrats have refused to allow a public hearing on any of this

UNACCEPTABLE.",2020-03-10 12:00:42
"Steele refuses to meet with US Attorney John Durham's investigators.

Steele's bogus dossier was filled with wild lies &amp; distortions, and used by the Deep State to justify their wrongful surveillance of @realDonaldTrump's campaign.

Why is he hiding from Durham? Expose the truth! https://t.co/i9EbcVrs1W",2020-03-09 14:16:47
"As a parent, nothing hurts more than watching your child experience pain in any form. 

This morning my wife, Dee Dee, and I send our thoughts and prayer to Rep. Graves and his family.

We ask that others join us in storming heaven for a speedy recovery. https://t.co/duByOmrJZV",2020-03-09 13:27:10
"There is a rising wave of violence by the Left in America.

Numerous assaults on @realDonaldTrump supporters and ANTIFA riots in the streets.

I fear this wave will only escalate as the Left continues to lash out.

@chuckschumer should call it out and work to stop it ‚Äî or resign. https://t.co/A0kLu88r55",2020-03-09 12:11:32
"Democrat candidates drop out, Pelosi says: ""America is misogynistic!""

Democrats should examine their candidates.

Crooked Hillary &amp; Pocahontas are not the leaders America wants. A woman will be president one day, just not those two.

Their problem isn't misogyny, it's mistrust! https://t.co/QT5XebIfEC",2020-03-07 13:37:55
"This is a great move for @realDonaldTrump &amp; America!

I've seen firsthand Mark's leadership on the House floor, at the @GOPoversight Committee, &amp; in @freedomcaucus.

I can tell you @RepMarkMeadows is one of America's finest public servants.

He'll do us proud at the @WhiteHouse! https://t.co/sp98DZnnsj",2020-03-07 01:44:41
"Seems Mitt Romney hasn't figured out yet what we do here.

Congress's job is to conduct oversight &amp; investigate corruption in our government.

But Romney shows an uncanny attachment to delusion.

Mitt, here's a fact:

America is sick of politicians who won't address corruption! https://t.co/O47jKvJZ3d",2020-03-06 14:16:06
